\section{Introduction}
\noindent
Jaatha is a fast composite likelihood method to estimate model parameters of the 
demographic history of (at the moment) two related species. To do so, it uses molecular
data from multiple individuals from both species.
This HowTo describes the method and gives an example of using its implementation
as \verb@R@ package \verb@jaatha@.

\section{A demographic model}
\noindent
Before we can apply Jaatha to estimate parameter, we first need to create a model
of the demographic history of the species.

% insert model picture and description here

To specify the above demographic model in \verb@R@, we first need to load \verb@jaatha@.
<<Loading Jaatha>>=
library(jaatha)
@
we can then create an 'empty' model \verb@dm@ using the \verb@dm.createDemographicModel()@
function:
<<Creating a demographic model in R>>=
dm <- dm.createDemographicModel(sampleSizes=c(25,24),nLoci=100,
						seqLength=10^3)
@
The parameter \verb@sampleSizes@ here states we have sampled molecular data from $25$ 
individuals of the first population and $24$ individuals from the second one. The 
second argument \verb@nLoci@ states are using data from $100$ independent loci in the
genome while \verb@seqLength@ gives the (average) length of each loci\footnote{This 
is only used when a finite sites model is assumed or if recombination is included.}.

We can now successively add the other assumptions of our model: 
<<Creating a demographic model in R>>=
dm <- dm.addSpeciationEvent(dm,.1,5)
dm <- dm.addSymmetricMigration(dm,.01,5)
dm <- dm.addMutation(dm,1,20)
dm <- dm.addRecombination(dm,fixed=5)
@
Here, the first parameter is always the demographic model to which we want to add
an assumption/feature, while the first number is the lowest possible value we assume
that our parameter could have and the second number is the highest possible value.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The parameter for the speciation event is the split time $\tau$, which
		states how many generations ago the split of the population has occurred.
		As usual in population genetics, its is measured in units of $4N_1$ 
		generations ago, where $N_1$ is effective population size of the first 
		population.
	\item The parameter for the (symmetric) migration is the scaled migration rate $M$, 
		which is given by $M=4N_1m$, where $m$ is the fraction of individuals of each 
		population which are replaced by immigrants from the other population each
		generation.
\end{itemize}

Keep in mind that a `good' model -- which one that approximates the real demographic
history but is also as simple as possible -- is crucial for getting meaningful 
estimates in the end. Jaatha will always try to find the parameters that make the
model fit best to the real data. If the model does not fit to the real data at all,
also the estimates will not be related to the real situation.
