	abstract = {While information about a species’ demography is interesting in its own right, it is an absolute necessity for certain types of population genetic analyses. The most widely used methods to infer a species’ demographic history do not take intralocus recombination or recent divergence into account, and some methods take several weeks to converge. Here, we present Jaatha, a new composite-likelihood method that does incorporate recent divergence and is also applicable when intralocus recombination rates are high. This new method estimates four demographic parameters. The accuracy of Jaatha is comparable to that of other currently available methods, although it is superior under certain conditions, especially when divergence is very recent. As a proof of concept, we apply this new method to estimate demographic parameters for two closely related wild tomato species, Solanum chilense and S. peruvianum. Our results indicate that these species likely diverged {1.44·N} generations ago, where N is the effective population size of S. chilense, and that some introgression between these species continued after the divergence process initiated. Furthermore, S. peruvianum likely experienced a population expansion following speciation.},

	abstract = {Summary: A Monte Carlo computer program is available to generate samples drawn from a population evolving according to a {Wright–Fisher} neutral model. The program assumes an infinite-sites model of mutation, and allows recombination, gene conversion, symmetric migration among subpopulations, and a variety of demographic histories. The samples produced can be used to investigate the sampling properties of any sample statistic under these neutral {models.Availability:} The source code for the program (in the language C) is available at http://home.uchicago.edu/\{\textasciitilde\}{rhudson1/source/mksamples.html.Contact:} rr-hudson@uchicago.edu},

	abstract = {Motivation: Seq-Gen is a program that will simulate the evolution of nucleotide sequences along a phylogeny, using common models of the substitution process. A range of models of molecular evolution are implemented, including the general reversible model. Nucleotide frequencies and other parameters of the model may be given and site-specific rate heterogeneity can also be incorporated in a number of ways. Any number of trees may be read in and the program will produce any number of data sets for each tree. Thus, large sets of replicate simulations can be easily created. This can be used to test phylogenetic hypotheses using the parametric bootstrap.
Availability: Seq-Gen can be obtained by {WWW} from {http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Seq-Gen/seq-gen.html} or by {FTP} from {ftp://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/packages/Seq-Gen/.} The package includes the source code, manual and example files. An Apple Macintosh version is available from the same sites.},
