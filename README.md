Jaatha
======

Jaatha is a frequentistic, simulation-based parameter estimation method primarily designed 
for Evolutionary Biology. The method is described in the publications

> L. Naduvilezhath, L.E. Rose and D. Metzler:
> Jaatha: a fast composite-likelihood approach to estimate demographic 
> parameters. Molecular Ecology 20(13):2709-23 (2011).

> L.A. Mathew, P.R. Staab, L.E. Rose and D. Metzler:
> [Why to account for finite sites in population genetic studies and 
> how to do this with Jaatha 2.0][1]. Ecology and Evolution (2013).

Practical instructions for running Jaatha are provided in the 
[The Jaatha HowTo][2]. Instructions how to use Jaatha with a non-standard 
simulation method are given in the [Custom Simulation Method HowTo][3]. 

Jaatha is developed openly on [GitHub][4]. Feel free to open an issue there if 
you encounter problems using Jaatha or have suggestions for future versions.
