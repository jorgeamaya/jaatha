Version 2.2
---------------
+ Added function for calculating BCa confidence intervals
+ Added "rerun" option to initial & refined search 
+ Switched form doMC to multicore for parallelization
+ Support for multiple independent summary statistics, even though this is not 
  yet used in the default front end.
+ Differentiated between unit and integration tests and moved the unit tests
  back into the package.
+ Reworked the reusing of simulations from previous steps in the refined search.
  Now only simulations that actually are inside the current block are reused. 
+ Removed the "score". We are always using the log-likelihood now.

+ Fixed problem with Rcpp in size_t on 64 bit windows

Version 2.1.1
---------------
+ Fixed warning messages in cpp files
+ Updated Makevars

Version 2.1
-------------
+ Removed the "externalTheta" option to simplify further development
+ Reworte and cleaned up many of the internal functions
+ Further seperated Jaatha and Demographic Model to simplify use of Jaatha
in other areas
+ Added caching for log factorials
+ Ported msFile2jsfs to Rcpp

be provided on Jaatha's homepage instead
