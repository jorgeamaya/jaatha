Version 2.2.3
---------------
+ Algorithm change: Removed epsilon. We now stop the refined search after the
  likelihood did not improve for 10 consecutive steps.
+ Algorithm change: Removed weight parameter to down-weight old simulations,
  because it had no measurable effect on the estimates.

Version 2.2.2
---------------
+ New Feature: Support for multiple groups of loci
+ New Feature: Possibility to smooth arrays of arbitrary dimension
+ Update: The Jaatha HowTo

Version 2.2.1
---------------
+ Modifications for Rcpp 0.11 (removed Makevars)
+ Updates the Jaatha HowTo

Version 2.2
---------------
+ Added function for calculating BCa confidence intervals
+ Added "rerun" option to initial & refined search 
+ Switched form doMC to multicore for parallelization
+ Support for multiple independent summary statistics, even though this is not 
  yet used in the default front end.
+ Differentiated between unit and integration tests and moved the unit tests
  back into the package.
+ Reworked the reusing of simulations from previous steps in the refined search.
  Now only simulations that actually are inside the current block are reused. 
+ Removed the "score". We are always using the log-likelihood now.
+ Added support for a new "poisson.smoothing" type of summary statistics. 

Version 2.1.3
-------------
+ Fixed problem with naming of temporary directories if Jaatha was executed
multiple times in different threads

Version 2.1.2
-------------
+ Fixed problem with Rcpp in size_t on 64 bit windows

Version 2.1.1
---------------
+ Fixed warning messages in cpp files
+ Updated Makevars

Version 2.1
-------------
+ Removed the "externalTheta" option to simplify further development
+ Reworte and cleaned up many of the internal functions
+ Further seperated Jaatha and Demographic Model to simplify use of Jaatha
in other areas
+ Added caching for log factorials
+ Ported msFile2jsfs to Rcpp
+ Removed vignettes from the package due to their long build time; The pdfs will
be provided on Jaatha's homepage instead 
+ Added citation information to the package  

Version 2.0.3
-------------
+ Added link to github repo to package description
+ Removed unused optimization strategies

Version 2.0.2
-------------
+ Bugfix: Changed the example fasta file for compatibility with next ape version
+ Bugfix: Fixed encoding issue with bibtex for the packages vignette

Version 2.0.1
-------------
+ Bugfix: Removed debug functions in C++ files that prevented installation on R-2.14

Version 2.0.0
-------------
+ Testing
+ Updated Documentation and Vignette
+ New Feature: Added caching of ms and seqgen commands
+ Changed Feature: Made use of /dev/shm optional
+ Bugfix: Multiple tmp-dirs used during multicore refined search
+ Bugfix: Multiple searches for seqgen binary if running on multiple cores

Version 1.9.12
-------------

+ Fixed a bug with one parameter models
+ Added support for seqgen
+ GLM fitting algorithm can now take more steps to converge
+ Updated the vignette
+ Ported seqgenFile2Jsfs.cc to Rcpp

Version 1.9.11
-------------
+ Added parallelization using doMC.
+ Some improvements to the UI.
+ Updated copyright information.
+ Added import from ape.
+ Updated the vignette.

Version 1.9.10
-------------
+ Use /dev/shm for temp files if available
+ Added "folded" option to use a folded JSFS
+ Added documentation for fasta2jsfs()
+ Made fasta2jsfs calculate the folded JSFS if no outgroup is given.

Version 1.9.9
-------------
+ Reworked the demographic model class to be more flexible and consistent.
