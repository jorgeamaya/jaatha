Version 2.6.0.9005
==================
- allows for an arbitrary number of parameters with variation.


Version 2.6.0.9003
==================
- Implement a candidate loci approach for selection. So far only for interal
  testing.


Version 2.6.0.9002
==================
- Allow for gamma distributed recombination and mutation rates
  between loci.


Version 2.6.0.9001
==================
- Add support for simulation with _scrm_.
  

Version 2.6.0.9000
==================
## Bug fixes
- Fix two bugs in CI calculation.
- Fix a harmless memory leak in experimental code (#19)


Version 2.6
==================
## Improvements
- Switched unittests from RUnit to testthat
- Added a Rcpp function to parse tree from ms(ms) output for seqgen. This should
  make seqgen less platform dependent (it still requires a Unix platform).
- Add a subset parameter to Jaatha.confidenceIntervals that allows to distribute
  the calculation on multiple machines.

## Bug fixes
- In 2.5.1, the ms output file was not delete when using seq-gen. This can cause
  Jaatha to fail if the disk runs out of space (#14). 
- Fixed a severe bug in the `Jaatha.confidenceIntevals` function. There often
  parameters different from the maximum likelihood estimates were used to
  calculate the confidence intervals (#15). 

## Clean-Ups
- Remove logging functionally. 


Version 2.5.1
==================
## Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug that caused seq-gen to fail if the mutation parameter was not the
  last model parameter.

## New Features
- Made it possible to use seq-gen together with msms (Linux only).


Version 2.5
==================
## Bug Fixes
- Fixed wrong description of N0 as size of the ancestral population in the documentation (#4)
- Fixed an bug with made jaatha abort when a point was slightly outside
  parameter range (#5)
- Fixed bug in calculation of JSFS introduced in 2.4-1 (#7)
- Now old simulations are actually reused (#8)
- It is no longer necessary to have a simulation program that can simulate all
  groups (#6)
- Different group now really use different simulation programs

## New Features
- Experimental support for an four-gamete-test based summary statistic

## Improvements
- Simplified internal simulation program interface
- Print dispatch for demographic model
- Modularized parsing of simulation output
- Models in different groups can now use different simulation software
- Now Jaatha simulates more data if it fails to fit the GLM
- Allow GLM more steps to converge
- Different Groups can now have different summary statistics
- Prioritizing system for simulations programs

## Clean-Ups
- Removed additional tmp-folders
- Removed dependency on foreach
- Changed dependency from dplyr to reshape2
- Removed optional logging into a file


Version 2.4
==================
## Algorithm changes:
- `Jaatha.initialSearch()` now divides the parameter space by all axis in turn,
  which makes the number of block linear instead of exponential in the
  parameter number.  

## New Features:
- Add an optional border to smoothing type summary statistics with is fitted
  via traditional transformations.

## Improvements:
- Using `dplyr` instead of `plyr` for converting JSFS into data frames because
  it is significantly faster.
- Striped unused components from the `glm` objects.


Version 2.3
==================
## Algorithm changes: 
  - Removed `epsilon`. We now stop the refined search after the
    likelihood did not improve for 10 consecutive steps.
  - Removed `weight` parameter to down-weight old simulations,
    because it had no measurable effect on the estimates.

## New Features: 
  - Support for multiple groups of loci
  - Possibility to smooth arrays of arbitrary dimension

## Improvements: 
  - Clarifies 'The Jaatha HowTo'


Version 2.2
==================
+ Added function for calculating BCa confidence intervals
+ Added `rerun` option to initial & refined search 
+ Switched form doMC to multicore for parallelization
+ Support for multiple independent summary statistics, even though this is not 
  yet used in the default front end.
+ Differentiated between unit and integration tests and moved the unit tests
  back into the package.
+ Reworked the reusing of simulations from previous steps in the refined search.
  Now only simulations that actually are inside the current block are reused. 
+ Removed the "score". We are always using the log-likelihood now.
+ Added support for a new "poisson.smoothing" type of summary statistics. 
+ Fixed problem with naming of temporary directories if Jaatha was executed
multiple times in different threads
+ Fixed problem with Rcpp in size_t on 64 bit windows
+ Fixed warning messages in cpp files
+ Updated Makevars


Version 2.1
==================
+ Removed the "externalTheta" option to simplify further development
+ Reworte and cleaned up many of the internal functions
+ Further seperated Jaatha and Demographic Model to simplify use of Jaatha
in other areas
+ Added caching for log factorials
+ Ported msFile2jsfs to Rcpp
+ Removed vignettes from the package due to their long build time; The pdfs will
be provided on Jaatha's homepage instead 
+ Added citation information to the package  
+ Added link to github repo to package description
+ Removed unused optimization strategies
+ Bugfix: Changed the example fasta file for compatibility with next ape version
+ Bugfix: Fixed encoding issue with bibtex for the packages vignette
+ Bugfix: Removed debug functions in C++ files that prevented installation on R-2.14


Version 2.0.0
==================
+ Updated Documentation and Vignette
+ New Feature: Added caching of ms and seqgen commands
+ Changed Feature: Made use of /dev/shm optional
+ Bugfix: Multiple tmp-dirs used during multicore refined search
+ Bugfix: Multiple searches for seqgen binary if running on multiple cores
+ Fixed a bug with one parameter models
+ Added support for seqgen
+ GLM fitting algorithm can now take more steps to converge
+ Updated the vignette
+ Ported seqgenFile2Jsfs.cc to Rcpp
+ Added parallelization using doMC.
+ Some improvements to the UI.
+ Updated copyright information.
+ Added import from ape.
+ Updated the vignette.
+ Use /dev/shm for temp files if available
+ Added "folded" option to use a folded JSFS
+ Added documentation for fasta2jsfs()
+ Made fasta2jsfs calculate the folded JSFS if no outgroup is given.
+ Reworked the demographic model class to be more flexible and consistent.
