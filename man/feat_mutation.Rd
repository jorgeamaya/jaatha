\title{Adds mutations to a demographic model}
\usage{
feat_mutation(rate, group = 0, variance = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{A \code{\link{Parameter}} defining the mutation rate (see above).}

\item{group}{Group of loci for with this feature is added. 0 means that
the feature applies to all groups, and 1 is the default group.
Set to 1 or an greater integer to set this feature only for
the corresponding group of loci.}

\item{variance}{Set to a value different from 0 to introduce variation in the
the parameter value for different loci. The
variation follows a gamma distribution with mean equal to
the value provided as \code{parameter}, and variance as given
here. Can also be set to a previously
created parameter, or an expression based on parameters.}
}
\value{
The feature, which can be added to a model using `+`.
}
\description{
This functions adds the assumption to the model that neutral mutations
occur in the genomes at a constant rate. The rate is quantified through
a parameter usually named theta in population genetics. It equals 4*N0*mu,
where N0 is the effective diploid population size of population one at the
time of sampling and mu is the neutral mutation rate for an entire locus.
}
\examples{
# A model with a constant scaled mutation rate of 5:
dm <- dm.createDemographicModel(c(15,20), 100) + feat_mutation(par_const(5))

# A model with a mutation rate that can be estimated with Jaatha:
dm <- dm.createDemographicModel(c(15,20), 100) +
  feat_mutation(par_range('theta', 1, 20))

# A model with variable gamma distributed mutation rate
dm <- dm.createDemographicModel(c(15,20), 100) +
  feat_mutation(par_range('theta', 1, 20), variance=100)
