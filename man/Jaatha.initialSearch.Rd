\title{Search the parameter space for good starting positions}
\usage{
Jaatha.initialSearch(jaatha, sim = 200, blocks.per.par = 2, rerun = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{jaatha}{The Jaatha settings (create with \code{\link{Jaatha.initialize}})}

\item{sim}{An integer stating the number of simulations that are performed for each
block.}

\item{blocks.per.par}{Integer. For each parameter axis in turn, we divide the
parameter space into \code{blocks.per.par} equally sized blocks by
restricting them to only a fraction of this axis.}

\item{rerun}{You can repeat a previously done initial search in Jaatha.
       Do do so, just call the initial search function with the jaatha
       object result of the first initial search and set rerun to 'TRUE'.}
}
\value{
The jaatha object with starting positions
}
\description{
This functions divides the parameter space in different parts (blocks).
In each block, simulations for different parameter combinations are run
to roughly predict the combination with the highest score (which is
equivalent to the highest composite log likelihood).
This points can later be used as starting positions for the second
estimation phase of Jaatha (\code{\link{Jaatha.refinedSearch}})
