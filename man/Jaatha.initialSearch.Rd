\arguments{
  \item{jaatha}{The Jaatha settings (create with
  \code{\link{Jaatha.initialize}})}

  \item{sim}{Numeric. The number of simulations that are
  performed in each bin}

  \item{blocks.per.par}{Numeric. The number of block per
  parameter.  Will result in Par^blocks.per.par blocks}

  search in Jaatha.  Do do so, just call the initial search
  function with the jaatha object result of the first
  initial search and set rerun to 'TRUE'.}

\description{
  This functions devides the parameter space in different
  parts (blocks). In each block, simulations for different
  parameter combinations are run to roughly predict the
  combination with the highest score (which is equivalent
  to the highest composite log likelihood). This points can
  later be used as starting positions for the secound
  estimation phase of Jaatha
  (\code{\link{Jaatha.refinedSearch}})
