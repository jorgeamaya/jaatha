\title{Create a basic demographic model}
\usage{
  dm.createDemographicModel(sample.sizes, loci.num,
    seq.length = 1000, log.level, log.file)
}
\arguments{
  \item{sample.sizes}{Number of individuals that are
  sampled. If your model consists of multiple populations,
  this needs to be a vector containing the sample sizes
  from each population.}

  \item{loci.num}{Number of loci that will be simulated}

  \item{seq.length}{(Average) number of bases for each
  locus}

  \item{log.level}{An integer specifing the amount of user
  readable output that will be produced.  0 = no output, 1
  = normal verbosity, ..., 3 = maximal verbosity.}

  \item{log.file}{If set, the debug output will be written
  into the given file}
}
\value{
  The demographic model
}
\description{
  This function creates a basic empty demographic model,
  which is returned. Features like mutation, pop.source
  splits and migration can be added afterwards.
}
\examples{
dm <- dm.createDemographicModel(sample.sizes=c(25,25), loci.num=100)
dm <- dm.addSpeciationEvent(dm,0.01,5)
dm <- dm.addMutation(dm,1,20)
