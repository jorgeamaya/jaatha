\name{dm.addSizeChange}
\alias{dm.addSizeChange}
\title{Adds an instantaneous change of the population size of one
population to a model.}
\usage{
dm.addSizeChange(dm, min.size.factor, max.size.factor, parameter = "q",
  population, at.time = "0")
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which the size change should be added.}

\item{min.size.factor}{If you want to estimate the size factor, this will be
used as the smallest possible value.}

\item{max.size.factor}{Same as min.size.factor, but the largest possible value.}

\item{parameter}{Instead of creating a new parameter, you can also
set the mutation rate to an expression based on existing
parameters. For example setting this to "tau" will use
an parameter with name tau that you have previously
created. You can also use R expression here, i.e. "2*tau"
or "5*M+2*tau" (if M is another parameter) will also
work (also this does not make much sense).}

\item{population}{The number of the population in which the spilt
occurs. See \link{dm.addSpeciationEvent} for more information.}

\item{at.time}{The time point at which the size changes.}
}
\value{
The demographic model with a size change.
}
\description{
This function changes the effective population size of one
population. The change is performed at a given time point
('at.time') and applies to the time interval farther into
the past from this point. The population size is set to a
fraction of N0, the present day size of population one.
}
\details{
If you want to add a slow, continuous change over some time,
then use the \link{dm.addGrowth} function.
}
\examples{
# A model with one smaller population
dm <- dm.createThetaTauModel(c(20,37), 88)
dm <- dm.addSizeChange(dm, 0.1, 1, population=2, at.time="0")
}
