\title{Initialization of a Jaatha estimation for population genetics}
\usage{
Jaatha.initialize(data, model, cores = 1, scaling.factor = 1,
  folded = FALSE, smoothing = FALSE, only_synonymous = FALSE,
  use_fpc = FALSE, fpc_populations = 1:2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The observed data. Jaatha can use data imported with package
\pkg{PopGenome}. Please refer the to the vignette
"The Jaatha HowTo" for more information.}

\item{model}{The demographic model to use}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use in parallel. If 0, it tries to
guess the number of available cores and use them all.}

\item{scaling.factor}{You can use this option if you have a large dataset. If
so, Jaatha only simulates only a fraction 1/scaling.factor of the
dataset and interpolates the missing data.}

\item{folded}{If 'TRUE', Jaatha will assume that the JSFS is folded.}

\item{smoothing}{If set to true, Jaatha uses a different way to summaries the
JSFS. Instead of binning certain areas, and fitting a glm per
area, only one glm is fitted for the complete JSFS, and the
position of the different entries is treated as a model
parameter. This feature is still experimental and not
recommended for productive use at the moment.}

\item{only_synonymous}{Only use synonymous SNP if set to \code{TRUE}. Requires
to provided \code{data} as a PopGenome "GENOME" object.}

\item{use_fpc}{Additionally to the JSFS, also use the four point condition
(FPC) summary statistc. The FPC statistic is sensitive for
recombination and selection, so consider adding it if your model has
either or both.}

\item{fpc_populations}{the populations within which the FPC statistic is
calculated if \code{use_fpc = TRUE}. Recommended settings are both
population unless the model has directional selection one population.
In that case, only use this population.}

\value{
A S4-Object of type jaatha containing the settings

\description{
This function sets the basic parameters for an analysis with
Jaatha and is the first step for each application of it.
