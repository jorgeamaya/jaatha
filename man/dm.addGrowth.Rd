\title{Adds an growth or decline of the population size of one
population to a model.}
\usage{
dm.addGrowth(dm, min.growth.rate = NA, max.growth.rate = NA,
  parameter = "alpha", population, at.time = "0")
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which the size change should be added.}

\item{min.growth.rate}{If you want to estimate the growth rate, this will be
used as the smallest possible value.}

\item{max.growth.rate}{Same as min.growth.rate, but the largest possible value.}

\item{parameter}{Instead of creating a new parameter, you can also
set the mutation rate to an expression based on existing
parameters. For example setting this to "alpha" will use
an parameter with name tau that you have previously
created. You can also use R expression here, i.e. "2*alpha"
or "5*M+2*alpha" (if M is another parameter) will also
work (also the latter does not make much sense).}

\item{population}{The number of the population in which the spilt
occurs. See \link{dm.addSpeciationEvent} for more information.}

\item{at.time}{The time point at which the size changes.}
}
\value{
The demographic model with a size change.
}
\description{
This function changes the growth factor of a population at given
point in time ('at.time'). This factor than applies to the time
interval farther into the past from this point.
}
\details{
The population size changes by factor exp(-alpha*t), where alpha
is the growth parameter and t is the time since the growth has
started. Hence, for positive alpha, the population will 'decline
backwards in time' or grow forwards in time. Similar, will decline
in forwards time for a negative value of alpha.

If you want to add an instantaneous change of the population size,
then use the \link{dm.addSizeChange} function.

\examples{
# A model with one smaller population
dm <- dm.createThetaTauModel(c(20,37), 88)
dm <- dm.addGrowth(dm, 0.1, 2, population=2, at.time="0")
}
