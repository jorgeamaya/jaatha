\title{Adds recombination events to a demographic model}
\usage{
dm.addRecombination(dm, lower.range = NA, upper.range = NA,
  parameter = "rho", group = 0, variance = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which recombination events should be added.}

\item{lower.range}{If you want to estimate the recombination rate (see note}

\item{upper.range}{Same as lower.range, but the largest possible value.}

\item{parameter}{Instead of creating a new parameter, you can also
set the mutation rate to an expression based on existing
parameters. For example setting this to "rho" will use
an parameter with name theta that you have previously
created. You can also use R expression here, so "2*rho"
or "5*rho+2*tau" (if tau is another parameter) will also
work (also it does not make much sense).}

\item{group}{Group of loci for with this feature is added. 0 means that
the feature applies to all groups, and 1 is the default group.
Set to 1 or an greater integer to set this feature only for
the corresponding group of loci.}

\item{variance}{Set to a value different from 0 to introduce variation in the
the parameter value for different loci. The
variation follows a gamma distribution with mean equal to
the value provided as \code{parameter}, and variance as given
here. Can also be set to a previously
created parameter, or an expression based on parameters.}

\value{
The demographic model with recombination
}
\description{
This function add the assumption to the model that recombination
events may occur within each locus. The corresponding parameter
- usually name rho - equals 4*N0*r, where r is the
probability that a recombination event within the locus will
occur in one generation. Even when using an infinite sites
mutation model, this assumes an finite locus length which is given
by the 'seq.length' parameter of the demographic model.
}
\details{
Please note that it does not make sense to estimate recombination
rates with Jaatha because it assumes unlinked loci.
