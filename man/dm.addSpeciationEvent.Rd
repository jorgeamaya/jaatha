\title{Adds a speciation event to a demographic model}
\usage{
dm.addSpeciationEvent(dm, min.time, max.time, fixed.time, in.population = 1,
  new.time.point = T, new.time.point.name = NA, time.point = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which the split should be added.}

\item{min.time}{If you want to estimate the time point, this will be
used as the smallest possible value.}

\item{max.time}{Same as min.time, but the largest possible value.}

\item{fixed.time}{If specified, the time.point will not be estimated,
but assumed to have the given value.}

\item{in.population}{The number of the population in which the spilt
occurs. See above for more information.}

\item{new.time.point}{If 'TRUE' a new parameter will be created using the
arguments 'min.time' and 'max.time' or
'fixed.time'. It will be named 'new.time.point.name'.
If 'FALSE' the argument 'time.point'
will be evaluated instead.}

\item{new.time.point.name}{The name for the new time point.}

\item{time.point}{Instead of creating a new parameter, you can also
set the mutation rate to an expression based on existing
parameters. For example setting this to "tau" will use
an parameter with name tau that you have previously
created. You can also use R expression here, i.e. "2*tau"
or "5*M+2*tau" (if M is another parameter) will also
work (also this does not make much sense).}
}
\value{
The demographic model with a split.
}
\description{
You can use this function the create a new population that splits
of from an existing population at a given time in the past. The time
can be given as parameter or as an expression based on previously
generated time points.
}
\details{
Time in measured in Number of 4N0 generations in the past,
where N0 is the size of population 1 at time 0.

The command will print the number of the new population, which will
be the number of previously existing populations plus one. The first
population has number "1".

dm <- dm.createDemographicModel(c(25,25), 100)
