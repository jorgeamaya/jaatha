\title{Adds symmetric migration between all populations}
\usage{
dm.addSymmetricMigration(dm, lower.range, upper.range, parameter = "M",
  time.start = "0")
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which migration events should be added.}

\item{lower.range}{If you want to estimate the migration parameter (see note}

\item{upper.range}{Same as lower.range, but the largest possible value.}

\item{parameter}{Instead of creating a new parameter, you can also
set the mutation rate to an expression based on existing
parameters. For example setting this to "M" will use
an parameter with name M that you have previously
created. You can also use R expression here, so "2*M"
or "5*M+2*tau" (if tau is another parameter) will also
work (also this does not make much sense).}

\item{time.start}{The time point at which the migration with this rate
starts.}
}
\value{
The demographic model with migration
}
\description{
This adds migration between all subpopulation, all with the same
rate. Please look at the documentation for \link{dm.addMigration} for
detailed information about migration.
}
\examples{
dm <- dm.createThetaTauModel(c(25,25), 100)
dm <- dm.addSymmetricMigration(dm, 0.01, 5, time.start="0.5*tau")
