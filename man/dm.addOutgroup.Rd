\title{Adds an outgroup to a demographic model}
\usage{
dm.addOutgroup(dm, separation_time, sample_size = 1, anc_pop = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which we add the outgroup}

\item{separation_time}{The time point at which the outgroup splits
from the ancestral population. This can be an absolute value
(e.g. 10) or relative to another time points (e.g. '5*t_split_1').}

\item{sample_size}{The number of individuals in the group}

\item{anc_pop}{The ancestral population of the non-outgroup individuals. The
outgroup splits from this population at the separation_time.}
}
\value{
The extended demographic model
}
\description{
This function adds an outgroup consisting of one individual to a
demographic model. The outgroup consists of one individual.
An outgroup is required for a finite sites analysis.
