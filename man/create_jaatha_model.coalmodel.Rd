\title{Use a coala model in Jaatha}
\usage{
\method{create_jaatha_model}{coalmodel}(x, jsfs_summary = c("sums", "none",
  "smooth"), ..., scaling_factor = 1, test = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The coala model}

\item{jsfs_summary}{The way the Joint Site Frquency Spectrum (JSFS)
is further summarized. Can be \code{sums} (default), \code{none} or
\code{"smoothing"}. For \code{sums}, 23 different areas of the JSFS
are summed up, and the sums are used as indepented Poission statistcs,
for \code{none}, all entries are used as indepented Possion statistics.
The value \code{smooth} is experimental so far and should not be used.
This option has no effect if the JSFS used as summary statistic in the
coala model.}

\item{...}{Additinoal parameters passed on to the dispatched functions.}

\item{scaling_factor}{If your model is a down-scaled version of your data,
you can indicated this using this value. The estimated expectation values
are multiplied with this factor before the likelihood is calculated.}

\item{test}{A logical indicating whether a simulation is performed to test
the model.}
}
\description{
This creates a Jaatha model from a coala model. Simulation for this model
model are conducted via the \code{simulate} function for the coala model.
The parameters that are
estimated must be specified via \code{\link[coala]{par_range}} and the
model must not have any other named parameters. Summary statistics present
in the coala model are used in Jaatha.
