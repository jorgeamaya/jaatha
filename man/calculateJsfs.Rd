\title{Calculates the JSFS for data imported with ape}
\usage{
calculateJsfs(ape.data, pop1.rows, pop2.rows, outgroup.rows = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{ape.data}{DNA sequence data of multiple individuals from two populations
and an optional outgroup sequence. It should be in a
format as returned by ape's 'read.dna' function. Please
refer to ape's manual for further details.}

\item{pop1.rows}{A numeric vector indicating which individuals of your
dataset belong to the first population. The individuals
are revered by their position in the dataset/their row
number in 'ape.data'.}

\item{pop2.rows}{Same as 'pop1.rows', but for the individuals of the second
population.}

\item{outgroup.rows}{Same as 'pop1.rows', but for the individuals of the
outgroup (if any). The outgroup can consist of more than
one individual to account for ancestral
misidentification. In this case, only positions in which
all outgroup sequences are identically are considered.
If no outgroup is given a folded JSFS is calculated.}
}
\value{
The calculated JSFS, as matrix.
}
\description{
The function 'read.dna' of package 'ape' allows you do import DNA data from
various formats into R. This function calculates the JSFS of such imported
data which can then be used as input for a Jaatha search. Please note that
the data must be aligned.
